# AjaxUpload

Display an upload area with [pqinoa/filepond](https://github.com/pqina/filepond)
for uploading multiple files in a form. The upload queues can be filled and
saved by FormIt hooks.

## Features

With the snippet an upload area for uploading multiple files in a form is
generated.

All uploaded files are given random filenames to avoid hotlinking uploaded not
published files.

With two FormIt hooks the upload queues can be pre-filled from FormIt field
value and saved into FormIt field value. With two other FormIt hooks the
uploaded files can be attached to the FormIt mails and deleted after the form
submit.

For more information please read the [documentation](https://jako.github.io/AjaxUpload/).
